# Print numbers from 1 to 10

This might be a very simple challenge, but I am surprised it hasn't been done on code-golf yet:

**Print all Integers from 1 to 10 inclusive in ascending order to standard output.**

Your output format can be whatever your language supports. This includes arbitrary separators (commas, semicolons, newlines, combinations of those, etc., but no digits), and prefixes and postfixes (like `[...]`). However, you may not output any other numbers than 1 through 10. Your program may not take any input. Standard loopholes are disallowed.

This is [tag:code-golf], so shortest answer in bytes wins!
