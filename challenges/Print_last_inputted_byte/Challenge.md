# Print last inputted byte

# Challenge

You have one string of input bytes, output the last byte in it.

# Rules

Your submission may be a program or function outputting the last byte in the input which

  - is either a string, *stdin* or command-line arguments, and
  - is non-empty.

I was trying to solve this with brainfuck, however all languages are allowed to participate. This is [tag:code-golf].

# Examples

    "?" -> "?"
    "29845812674" -> "4"
