# Replicate "dotnet ef" unicorn

.Net Technology is an incredible framework with marvellous functionalities, and among all of them, the most important one obviously stands out.

Yep, your simple task is create a program that when it takes at input: 

    dotnet ef

It prints the following ascii art by output:

                 /\__
           ---==/    \\
     ___  ___   |.    \|\
    | __|| __|  |  )   \\\
    | _| | _|   \_/ |  //|\\
    |___||_|       /   \\\/\\

And you have to do it in the lowest number of bytes of course.

**Rules**

 - If the program doesn't receive `dotnet ef` by input it doesn't output anything
 - The program with the fewest bytes wins so this is a code golf challenge
